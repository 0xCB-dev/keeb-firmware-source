# Nomad Keyboard

The Nomad is a 7Ã—5 keys column-staggered split keyboard based largely on the Sofle Choc, borrowing they physical layout from the OMKBD ErgoDash.
It uses low profile Kailh Choc switches with hotswap sockets and features per-key RGB lighting via SK6812 Mini-E LEDs.
Compared to the Sofle Choc the nomad offers an additional thumb cluster key, an additional modifier key in the 5th row and a 7th inner column with 3 keys each.
